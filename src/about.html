<a href="/">Acronymy</a> is a backronym dictionary that anyone can edit.
I like to think of it as a massively multiplayer online collaborative
word game.
</p>

<p>Acronymy began life in 2014 as one of the first <a href="https://sandstorm.org/">Sandstorm</a> apps.
In 2022, I ported it to the
<a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>
platform
and added many new features such as definition attribution and history.
</p>

<p>
For SIGBOVIK 2023, I made a <a href="http://youtu.be/LjOHnXRIp4Y">3-minute video</a>
about Acronymy, including a discussion of
<a href="https://github.com/dwrensha/acronymy-assistant">Acronymy Assistant</a>,
which is a tool that can provide automatic help in backronym construction.
</p>

<p>
After we surpassed 10,000 definitions in December 2024,
I made a <a href="https://youtu.be/_0tNWWhPYYs">video</a>
to illustrate some definitions from the top contributors.</p>
