The Acronymy word list is a combination of several sources:

  1. Webster's Second International, as it appeared in /usr/share/dict/words
     on my Macbook in 2014. According to the README at /usr/share/dict/README,
     the 1934 copyright has lapsed on this data.

  2. [cracklib-small](https://github.com/cracklib/cracklib/blob/6e330cba3134c6e864b106e3b13979e705a9b03b/src/dicts/cracklib-small).

  3. Tom 7's wordlist.asc, referenced in http://tom7.org/portmantout/ and http://golf.horse/wordlist.asc/ .

Additionally, I have made a bunch of manual removals and additions.
